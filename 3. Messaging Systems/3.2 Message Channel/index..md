# Message Channel
A message channel connects applications, allowing one application to write information while another reads from the same channel.

Here’s how it works:

* When an application wants to communicate, it sends information to a specific message channel.
* Another application retrieves that information from the same channel.

Keep in mind that while channels are essential for communication, they aren’t entirely free. Some applications require numerous channels, which consume memory and disk resources. Most messaging system implementations have practical limits on the number of channels they can consistently handle.
